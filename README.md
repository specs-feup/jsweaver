# Jackdaw

**This compiler has been phased out, and will not work with current versions of the LARA framework.**

**If you want to compile it, do it against the branch `lara-2.0-legacy` of the [LARA](https://github.com/specs-feup/lara-framework/tree/lara-2.0-legacy) and [specs-java-libs](https://github.com/specs-feup/specs-java-libs/tree/lara-2.0-legacy) repositories**
